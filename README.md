# Word Spinner Project

# Description
This program reads text from an input file (`essay.txt`) and replaces certain words with their synonyms from a synonym dictionary file (`test-synonyms.txt`). It prints the original text and three modified versions to `results.txt`.

The goal is to demonstrate simple natural language processing with random synonym substitution.

# Files

- `Spinner.py`: Contains the `Spinner` class that handles synonym replacement.
- `SpinFile.py`: The main script that reads the essay, processes it using `Spinner`, and saves the results.
- `essay.txt`: Input text to be spun.
- `test-synonyms.txt`: Smaller version for quick testing.
- `results.txt`: Output file where the original and modified versions are saved.
